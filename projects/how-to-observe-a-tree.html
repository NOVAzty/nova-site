      <p class="en">'Observation'- a behavior with a clear subject object relationship, meaning that it seems natural to place trees in the position of being 'observed'. This work aims to break away from the inherent concept of anthropocentrism, simulate the intersection and integration of the dual perspectives of 'human - tree' and 'tree - human', and complete the process of 'observation perception (connection) regeneration' reconstruction of human beings and trees in the short but continuous reality, dreams, and thinking. It explores the possibility of dissolution  
of the binary relationship between human and natural subjects and objects today. </p>

      <p class="en">How to observe a tree? </p>

      <p class="en">Born in the world, trapped in the world, breathing is a process of blending with trees, thoughts grow like lush branches and leaves, and humans not only use tree materials to create shelters, but also artistic works, technology and industry, natural locality Humans draw infinite inspiration from trees, gradually developing forms, movements, and consciousness similar to trees. Humans strive to study them in order to make the best use of resources, protect the environment, and return to nature.</p>
    
      <p>Have we ever learned about trees? Yes, but humans never believe that plants can be equal to humans.</p>

      <p>The feeling of the green leaves and sunlight shining all over the body that cannot be touched, including forward, downward, upward, and upward, extends from visual and auditory senses to the five senses At one moment, trees became one with us. Touching it, the folds and grooves seem to carry the mottled marks of time. We will continue to broaden our perspective and discover many previously overlooked discoveries, such as plant intelligence research. </p>

      <p>Perhaps only when we break free from the anthropocentric perspective and establish a connection with trees on an equal footing, will we realize that when we have tried to 'observe' trees, are they also 'observing' us: trees that have been lost due to logging, are they 'observing' refugees who have been homeless due to war? Are trees, which have been confined by urban planning, also 'observing' densely populated residential areas that have been squeezed by overpopulation But in most cases, humans justify these emotions, and the behaviors of separation, biological plagiarism, capitalist competition, and hostile thoughts have not even spared their own kind. We will be controlled by the forces of nature, but we will also be consumed by ourselves time and time again. We are anxious, confused, arrogant, and cowardly. We think we are strong and capable, but we are ignorant. </p>

      <p>Whose nature? Is there any other way? Will it regenerate? Will there be a new utopia? Can ecology really guide our behavior? Or can it always be limited to poetic expression? </p>

      <p>Unknown as ever, we have never known the answer. </p>

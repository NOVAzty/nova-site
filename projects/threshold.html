      <p class="en">Threshold is the liminal space of bodily and emotional transformation — a place where sound and the body meet at their most delicate edge.Gaze, in its silence, forges a connection with the world — and becomes a quiet reunion with the self. </p>

      <p class="en">From sitting in stillness at the threshold to meeting the vividness of a face, we catch glimpses of what it means to confront the self: confused, fragile, yet still trying to carry on with quiet resolve. </p>

      <p class="en">We long to cross the grand thresholds of life, yet often forget to notice the subtle tremors — of love, of memory, and of all that remains unreachable.</p>
    
      <p class="en">May you and I both rediscover our vulnerability in those fleeting moments where gaze and sound gently intertwine.</p>

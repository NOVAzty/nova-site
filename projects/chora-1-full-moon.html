      <p class="en">Chora is a container in a state of being in motion— invisible and formless. It is perceptible but indefinable, where various contradictions can struggle against each other.</p>

      <p class="en">Under the traditional ideology of binary opposition, the full moon is generally endowed with the image of the traditional feminine energy: softness and fullness. The transition from defect to round in about 30 days is pointed to as menstruation, and it is a symbol of fertility. But almost no one has truly “touched” the bright full moon— is what we see real? The mixed sense of chaos in reality and imagination, this indescribable state, is precisely what Chora possesses. Everything comes from exploring the curious unknown; under this intuition, escape from reality further evolves into the discovery of oneself, thus obtaining an unprecedented energy field and a new cure.</p>

      <p class="en">To transcend the constraints of time and space is to expand the capacity of perception, until an original “body” emerges— one that has never been touched by language. By blurring the boundaries between music, dance, vision, and installation, we invite everyone to explore concepts such as gender, energy fields, deification worship, and the balance between order and destruction.</p>

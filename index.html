    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      Tianyi Zhang (NOVA) is graduated from Music Design and Production in the Department of Music Engineering at Shanghai Conservatory of Music. She focuses on the cross-border fusion of art, technology and philosophy. Her creative fields include experimental electronic music, new media theater, experimental video, performance art, noise and alternative music.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      She actively explores cross-media expressions of sound, image, movement and installation, with a focus on subjective sonic perception and non-linear narrative structures. Chaos and intermediate states are her current research interests.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      She is the founder of the interdisciplinary art collective M1∞ (M1 Infinitas), which seeks to break down disciplinary boundaries and promote experimental collaborations across sound, performance, technology and philosophy.

      Her commissioned theater piece <em>Falling from the Sky</em> was performed at the China Shanghai International Arts Festival (2023) and selected for the RAW Young Artists Support Program.

Her works have been presented at institutions including Shanghai Music Hall, YUZ Museum Shanghai, HOW Art Museum, and others.

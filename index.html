She focuses on the cross-border fusion of art, technology and philosophy. Her creative fields include experimental electronic music, new media theater, experimental video, performance art,  noise and alternative music. She actively explores the cross-media expression of sound art and visual, dance, installation, etc., focusing on the subjective expression of sound, so as to form diversified narrative/non-narrative creations. Chaos and intermediate states are her current research interests.
